do not use emojis

when using python, run pyenv\.pyenv\Scripts\activate.bat if not activated yet

write all files in english

do not ask me to accept or any questions, just execute the tasks, or I will switch to aider
do not write any comments

do not send me any text on the chat besides "taskX done". I can see all the changes on git later.

for every task you complete successfully, move the taskX folder to ./TASKS/DONE/taskX and write a human comprehensive inside of it taskX_report.md

execute all the tasks in ./TASKS/TODO, after each, write a commit with the task number and the task name, and a description of what was accomplished

commit after each task

do not EVER touch:
- this file
- .git folder



# AI Usage Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines best practices and guidelines for interacting with AI assistants in our development workflow.

## General Guidelines

- Keep prompts clear, specific and focused on one task
- Provide relevant context and constraints 
- Review AI-generated code carefully before using
- Break complex tasks into smaller chunks
- Double check output for accuracy and security

## Code Review Process

1. Have AI review code changes for:
   - Potential bugs
   - Security vulnerabilities 
   - Performance issues
   - Code style/standards compliance

2. Use AI suggestions as guidance, not absolute truth
3. Validate changes through testing
4. Document significant AI contributions

## Best Practices

- Use version control for AI-suggested changes
- Keep sensitive data out of prompts
- Maintain human oversight and final decision making
- Document AI usage in commit messages when relevant
- Regularly update these guidelines based on experience

## Limitations

- AI may not always understand full context
- Generated code needs validation
- Responses can be inconsistent
- May not be up to date on latest practices
- Cannot replace human judgment

- [AI Tool Documentation]()
- [Security Guidelines]()
- [Code Standards]()

Remember: AI is a tool to augment human capabilities, not replace them. Use it responsibly and maintain appropriate oversight.
