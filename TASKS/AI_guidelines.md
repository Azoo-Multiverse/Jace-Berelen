do not use emojis

write all files in english

do not ask me to accept or any questions, just execute the tasks,  or I will switch to aider

do not send me any text on the chat besides "taskX done". I can see all the changes on git later.

for every task you complete successfully, move the taskX folder to ./TASKS/DONE/taskX and write a human comprehensive taskX_report.md

execute all the tasks in ./TASKS/TODO, after each, write a commit with the task number and the task name, and a description of what was accomplished

commit after each task

do not EVER touch:
- this file
- .git folder
- deliver.py

run "python deliver.py" after executing each task
