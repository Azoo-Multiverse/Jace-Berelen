# Task 5: Code Adaptation and Test Fixes

Following ./TASKS/AI_guidelines.md:

1. Resolve test failures:
   - Fix failing unit tests
   - Fix failing integration tests
   - Update code to meet test requirements
   - Document any design changes needed

2. Improve code testability:
   - Refactor complex functions
   - Extract hard-to-test components
   - Implement dependency injection where needed
   - Add logging for test debugging

3. Final verification:
   - Run complete test suite
   - Generate coverage report
   - Document any remaining skip conditions
   - Update documentation with test results

Expected outcome: All tests passing with 100% coverage
