# Task 3: Unit Test Implementation

Following ./TASKS/AI_guidelines.md:

1. Create unit tests for each module in src/:
   - Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases)
   - Test each function/method independently
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure doctest examples are included where appropriate

2. Implement test coverage reports:
   - Configure coverage.py
   - Set minimum coverage threshold to 100%
   - Generate HTML reports

3. Create unit test documentation:
   - Document test strategy
   - Document mock setup and usage
   - Document skip conditions

Expected outcome: Complete unit test suite with 100% coverage for testable code
