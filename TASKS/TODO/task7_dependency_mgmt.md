# Task: Enhance Dependency Management

## Description
Develop an advanced dependency management system for tasks that handles complex relationships, detects cycles, and optimizes execution order.

## Requirements
- Implement a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for task relationships
- Add cycle detection and resolution
- Create dependency visualization
- Support for optional vs. required dependencies
- Implement partial task completion and dependency satisfaction

## Acceptance Criteria
- Complex dependency chains are correctly managed
- Circular dependencies are detected and reported
- Visualization clearly shows task relationships
- System handles partial completions appropriately
- Performance is maintained with large dependency trees
