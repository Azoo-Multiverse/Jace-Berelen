# Task: Implement Intelligent Caching

## Description
Implement a caching system to store and reuse analysis results and implementation plans for similar tasks, reducing API calls and improving efficiency.

## Requirements
- Create a caching mechanism for API responses
- Implement similarity detection for tasks
- Store cache in a persistent format (JSON/SQLite)
- Add cache invalidation strategy
- Measure and report token savings

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cache hit rate of at least 25% for similar tasks
- Verifiable reduction in API calls
- No degradation in output quality
- Cache persistence between sessions
