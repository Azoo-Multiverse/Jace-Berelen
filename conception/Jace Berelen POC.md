# Jace Berelen POC - AI-Powered Workflow Automation Platform

## What is Jace Berelen?

Jace Berelen is an AI-powered assistant built specifically for developers and professionals who manage multiple jobs simultaneously. Think of it as an intelligent automation layer that sits between you and your work, helping you stay organized, productive, and efficient across different projects and employers.

## The Problem It Solves

Many skilled developers practice "overemployment" - working multiple remote jobs at the same time to maximize income. While this can be financially rewarding, it creates significant challenges:

- **Context Switching**: Constantly switching between different codebases, clients, and work styles
- **Task Management**: Keeping track of deadlines, priorities, and deliverables across multiple employers
- **Communication Overhead**: Managing different Slack workspaces, email accounts, and project management tools
- **Knowledge Management**: Remembering project-specific information, coding standards, and business rules
- **Time Allocation**: Balancing workload to meet all commitments without burning out

## Technical Architecture

Jace is built as a modern web application with the following stack:

### Backend
- **Python 3.11+** with FastAPI for high-performance async web APIs
- **SQLAlchemy** for database ORM with support for both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production)
- **Pydantic** for data validation and settings management
- **Uvicorn/Gunicorn** for ASGI server deployment

### AI Integration
- **OpenRouter API** for accessing multiple AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, etc.)
- **Anthropic Claude** as the primary AI model for code assistance and task automation
- **Custom prompt engineering** for specialized overemployment workflows

### Communication
- **Slack SDK** for bot integration and real-time messaging
- **Webhook support** for GitHub, Trello, and other development tools
- **RESTful API** for programmatic access

### Deployment
- **Railway** for cloud hosting with automatic deployments
- **PostgreSQL** for production database
- **Docker-ready** configuration for containerized deployment

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Task Management
The system maintains a comprehensive task database that tracks:
- **Job-specific tasks** with priority levels and deadlines
- **Cross-project dependencies** and potential conflicts
- **Automated task breakdown** using AI to split complex requirements into manageable chunks
- **Time estimation** based on historical data and AI analysis

### 2. AI-Powered Code Assistant
- **Code generation** for common patterns and boilerplate
- **Code review** and bug detection
- **Architecture suggestions** for scalable solutions
- **Documentation generation** from code comments and structure
- **Refactoring recommendations** for better maintainability

### 3. Multi-Job Context Management
- **Isolated workspaces** for each employer to prevent information leakage
- **Context-aware responses** that understand which job you're currently working on
- **Automated time tracking** and productivity metrics
- **Smart scheduling** to optimize work distribution

### 4. Communication Automation
- **Slack bot integration** for natural language interaction
- **Automated status updates** and progress reports
- **Meeting scheduling** and calendar management
- **Client communication** templates and best practices

## How It Works

### 1. Setup and Configuration
```python
# Example configuration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = "xoxb-your-bot-token"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "sk-or-your-api-key"
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db"
```

### 2. Daily Workflow
1. **Morning Standup**: Jace analyzes your calendar and provides a prioritized task list
2. **Continuous Assistance**: Ask questions, get code help, track progress throughout the day
3. **Context Switching**: Jace helps you transition between different jobs and projects
4. **End-of-Day Review**: Automatic progress tracking and next-day planning

### 3. AI Interaction Examples
```
You: "I need to implement user authentication for the React app"
Jace: "I'll help you implement JWT-based auth. Here's a complete solution with:
- Backend API endpoints for login/register
- Frontend React hooks for auth state
- Middleware for protected routes
- Security best practices"
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
The system uses a relational database with key entities:
- **Users**: Individual developers using the system
- **Jobs**: Different employers/clients
- **Tasks**: Work items with job associations
- **AI Interactions**: Conversation history and cost tracking
- **Work Sessions**: Time tracking and productivity metrics

### AI Cost Management
- **Usage tracking** per user and per job
- **Budget limits** to prevent overspending
- **Cost optimization** by choosing appropriate models for different tasks
- **Detailed analytics** on AI usage patterns

### Security Considerations
- **Data isolation** between different jobs
- **Encrypted sensitive information** in database
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Audit logging** for compliance
