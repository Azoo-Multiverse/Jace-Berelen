# Task: Implement Result Validation System

## Description
Create a comprehensive validation system that automatically verifies task outputs against requirements, checks test results, and analyzes code quality.

## Requirements
- Implement automatic test runner with result parsing
- Add code coverage analysis
- Create validation reports with pass/fail status
- Implement requirement-to-implementation traceability
- Detect common issues in implementations

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests are automatically executed and verified
- Code coverage is measured and reported
- Validation results are stored with each task
- Failed validations trigger appropriate actions
- Detailed validation reports are generated
