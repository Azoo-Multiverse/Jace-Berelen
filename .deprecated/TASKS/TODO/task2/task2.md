# Task 2: Test Infrastructure Setup

Following ./TASKS/AI_guidelines.md:

1. Create test infrastructure:
   - tests/unit/ directory
   - tests/integration/ directory
   - tests/conftest.py for shared fixtures
   - tests/requirements-test.txt for test dependencies

2. Setup pytest configuration:
   - pytest.ini with coverage settings
   - Custom markers for tests requiring API keys
   - Skip conditions for API-dependent tests

3. Create basic test structure:
   - Test modules matching source structure
   - Empty test classes/functions for each source module

Expected outcome: Complete test infrastructure ready for implementation
