---

# 5. Security Framework

## 5.1 Security Design Principles

### Basic Security (Stage 0)
- AI models never access `.env`, secrets, or full repo unless required
- All AI tasks run in secure Docker containers with scoped volumes
- The orchestrator signs off on all deploy-level actions
- GitHub PRs require Slack approval before merging
- Production systems can run 100% airgapped (manual bundle delivery)

### Enhanced Security Framework (Stage 1+)

**Zero Trust Architecture:**
- Assume every component is compromised
- Implement mutual TLS between all services
- Use short-lived tokens (15-minute max)
- Log every access attempt

**Container Security:**
- Use **non-root users** in all containers
- Implement **seccomp** and **AppArmor** profiles
- Run containers with **read-only filesystems**
- Use **distroless** base images

**Data Protection:**
- Encrypt all data at rest and in transit
- Implement **data retention policies** (auto-delete after 90 days)
- Use **field-level encryption** for sensitive data in database
- Add **PII detection** to prevent accidental exposure

## 5.2 Secrets Management Best Practices
- Rotate all secrets every 30 days
- Use different secrets per environment
- Implement **secret scanning** in CI/CD
- Never log secrets or sensitive data

---

# 6. Cost Optimization Strategy

## 6.1 Cost Calculation Model

### Basic Formula
```
C = (U_api × R_api) + (U_llm × R_llm) + (H_gpu × R_gpu) + M_supabase
```

Where:
- U_api = number of external API calls (e.g., GPT-4)
- R_api = cost per API call
- U_llm = number of local LLM calls
- R_llm = cost per local execution (≈ energy use)
- H_gpu = GPU usage in hours
- R_gpu = hourly cost for local GPU (amortized)
- M_supabase = Supabase monthly subscription

### Example Calculation
```
C = (1500 × 0.003) + (3000 × 0.0005) + (120 × 0.02) + 25 = $33.40
```

## 6.2 Enhanced Cost Model
```
C = Infrastructure + AI_Usage + Third_Party + Labor + Opportunity_Cost

Where:
Infrastructure = (Server + Storage + Network + Monitoring)
AI_Usage = (External_API + Local_Compute + GPU_Hours)
Third_Party = (Supabase + GitHub + Slack + Monitoring_Tools)
Labor = (Development + Maintenance + Support)
Opportunity_Cost = (Revenue_Lost_from_System_Downtime)
```

## 6.3 Cost Optimization Tactics

### AI Cost Reduction
- **Prompt caching** for repeated queries
- **Model quantization** for local LLMs (4-bit/8-bit)
- **Request batching** for API calls
- **Smart model routing** (easy tasks → cheap models)
- **Context compression** to reduce token usage

### Infrastructure Optimization
- **Spot instances** for non-critical workloads
- **Auto-scaling** based on task queue length
- **Resource pooling** across multiple jobs
- **Efficient container scheduling**

### Budget Management
- Set **hard limits** per client/project
- Implement **cost alerts** before budget exhaustion
- Create **cost allocation** reports per client
- **Emergency shutdown** procedures for runaway costs

# 7. Workflow & Task Management

## 7.1 Workflow Routing Logic

### Current State Machine
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Listening : Slack / Trello / Email
    Listening --> Routing : Parse & Validate
    Routing --> Executing
    Executing --> Logging : Log outputs
    Logging --> Idle
```

### Enhanced State Machine (Recommended)
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initialized
    Initialized --> Idle : System Ready
    Idle --> Listening : Event Received
    Listening --> Validating : Parse Input
    Validating --> Queued : Valid Task
    Validating --> Error : Invalid Input
    Queued --> Executing : Agent Available
    Queued --> Waiting : Agent Busy
    Waiting --> Executing : Agent Free
    Executing --> Completed : Success
    Executing --> Failed : Error
    Executing --> Timeout : Time Limit
    Completed --> Logging : Log Success
    Failed --> Retry : Retryable Error
    Failed --> Logging : Final Failure
    Timeout --> Retry : Timeout Retry
    Retry --> Queued : Retry Attempt
    Logging --> Idle : Done
    Error --> Idle : Error Handled
```

## 7.2 Task Trigger Examples

### Basic Triggers (Stage 0)
- `/jace aider edit app.py` → starts background agent
- `/jace test https://github.com/user/repo` → clones, runs pytest, posts result
- `/jace scrape https://example.com` → uses Selenium, returns text or screenshot

### Advanced Triggers (Stage 1+)
- Trello card tagged `auto-design` → invokes `ui_drafter` agent
- GitHub PR created by client → summary + test results posted back
- Email with `subject: PROD DOWN` → escalation to Telegram + summary

### Smart Trigger Processing
- **Priority detection** from natural language ("urgent", "ASAP", "when you have time")
- **Context extraction** from surrounding messages or card descriptions
- **Dependency resolution** (don't start Task B until Task A completes)
- **Resource availability** checking before trigger activation

## 7.3 Task Categorization by Complexity

**Level 1 - Basic Automation (High Success Rate):**
- File organization and cleanup
- Simple data transformations (CSV → JSON)
- Basic text processing and formatting
- Standard report generation
- Simple API data fetching

**Level 2 - Intermediate Intelligence (Medium Success Rate):**
- Code review and suggestions
- Documentation generation from code
- Test case generation
- Basic design recommendations
- Data analysis with insights

**Level 3 - Advanced AI Tasks (Requires Human Review):**
- Architecture recommendations
- Complex business logic generation
- Creative content creation
