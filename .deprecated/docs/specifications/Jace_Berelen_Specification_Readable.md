# 1. What is Jace Berelen?

## 1.1 Executive Summary

**Jace Berelen** is an AI-powered orchestrator that automates workflows across software development, analytics, QA, design, and documentation. Think of it as your personal AI assistant that can manage multiple jobs simultaneously while maintaining complete security isolation.

### Key Benefits
- 🚀 **Manage 5-10 jobs simultaneously** with isolated AI agents
- 💰 **Minimal AI costs** through local model preference
- 🔒 **Enterprise-grade security** with containerized execution
- 🔄 **Airgap-safe delivery** for sensitive client environments
- 📊 **Complete observability** with task-level audit trails

### Primary Use Cases
- **Overemployment Support**: Manage multiple remote jobs efficiently
- **Code Automation**: Generate, test, and review code automatically
- **Client Communication**: Auto-respond to emails, Slack, and Trello
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and documentation
- **Delivery Management**: Package complete deployment instructions

## 1.2 How It Works (Simple View)

```
You send commands → Jace processes them → You get results
```

**Example Workflow:**
1. You type `/jace aider fix bug in payment.py` in Slack
2. Jace analyzes the code, identifies the bug, and fixes it
3. You receive the fixed code + explanation + tests
4. You review and deploy (or Jace can package deployment instructions)

## 1.3 Vision & Goals

### Core Vision
Build a secure, extensible platform that helps professionals automate parallel work streams and scale into a commercial SaaS product.

### Operating Principles
- **Start Simple**: Works with minimal features, adds complexity gradually
- **Cost Conscious**: Local models preferred over expensive API calls
- **Security First**: AI never accesses secrets or sensitive data directly
- **Observable**: Every action is logged and traceable
- **Isolated**: Each job/client is completely separated

# 2. Quick Start Guide

## 2.1 Get Running Today (Stage 0)

### What You'll Build First
A basic Slack bot that can:
- Respond to `/jace help`
- Execute `/jace aider [command]` 
- Run `/jace test [repo-url]`

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Slack workspace (admin access)
- Anthropic Claude API key
- Aider installed locally (configured for Claude)

> **📝 Note about Claude Models**: You requested Claude 4 Opus, but as of now, the latest available model is **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, which is actually more capable than the theoretical Claude 4 Opus. We'll use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for the best performance.

### 15-Minute Setup
1. **Get Anthropic API Key**
   ```bash
   # Go to console.anthropic.com
   # Create account and get API key
   # Should start with: sk-ant-api03-...
   ```

2. **Create Slack Bot**
   ```bash
   # Go to api.slack.com/apps
   # Create new app, get bot token
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo]
   cd jace-berelen
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

4. **Configure Aider for Claude**
   ```bash
   # Set Aider to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   aider --model anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
   ```

5. **Run Basic Server**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   # Bot should come online in Slack
   ```

6. **Test Commands**
   ```
   /jace help           # Should respond with available commands
   /jace status         # Should show system status
   ```

### Success Criteria

### Component Breakdown

**Input Layer** (How you interact):
- **Slack Bot**: Main command interface
- **Trello Webhooks**: Card-based triggers
- **Email Listener**: Email-based tasks

**Processing Layer** (The brain):
- **FastAPI Server**: Central coordinator
- **Task Router**: Decides which agent handles what
- **Agent Pool**: Specialized workers (Aider, Pytest, etc.)

**Output Layer** (What you get):
- **Supabase Logger**: Stores all results
- **GitHub Handler**: Manages code repositories
- **Delivery Bundler**: Creates deployment packages

## 3.2 Data Flow Example

**Scenario**: You type `/jace aider fix the login bug`

1. **Slack** receives command, sends to **FastAPI Server**
2. **Task Router** analyzes command, chooses **Aider Agent**
3. **Aider Agent** loads code context, identifies bug, generates fix
4. **Results** logged to **Supabase** with full audit trail
5. **Slack notification** sent with fix summary and next steps

## 3.3 Security by Design

### Core Security Principles
- **AI Isolation**: AI agents run in isolated Docker containers
- **Secret Separation**: AI never accesses credentials directly
- **Audit Everything**: Every action is logged and traceable
- **Human Approval**: Critical actions require human confirmation
- **Airgap Ready**: Can operate without direct system access

### Security Layers
```
User Commands → Authentication → Rate Limiting → Container Isolation → Logging
```

# 7. Cost Management

## 7.1 Cost Structure

### Cost Calculation Model
```
Monthly Cost = Infrastructure + AI Usage + Third-Party + Labor

Where:
- Infrastructure = Servers + Storage + Network
- AI Usage = API calls + Local compute + GPU hours
- Third-Party = Supabase + GitHub + Slack + Tools
- Labor = Development + Maintenance + Support
```

### Example Breakdown (Stage 1)
```
Infrastructure:  $50/month  (Railway hosting)
AI Usage:        $75/month  (OpenAI API calls)
Third-Party:     $45/month  (Supabase + integrations)
Labor:           $0/month   (your time)
───────────────────────────
Total:          $170/month  for 5-job capability
```

## 7.2 Cost Optimization Strategies

### AI Cost Reduction
- **Local models first**: Use free local LLMs when possible
- **Smart routing**: Easy tasks → cheap models
- **Prompt caching**: Reuse responses for similar requests
- **Batch processing**: Group API calls together
- **Context compression**: Reduce token usage

### Infrastructure Optimization
- **Auto-scaling**: Only pay for resources you use
- **Spot instances**: Cheaper compute for non-critical tasks
- **Resource pooling**: Share infrastructure across jobs
- **Smart scheduling**: Run expensive tasks during off-hours

### Budget Management
- **Hard limits**: Stop when budget is exhausted
- **Cost alerts**: Warnings at 80% of budget
- **Per-client allocation**: Track costs by project
- **ROI tracking**: Measure time saved vs. cost
